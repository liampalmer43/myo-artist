Use the Myo Armband to create art without a canvas!  Use your arm's orientation to draw on a 3D virtual plane in front of you, and witness the picture come to life on your computer screen.  Use Myo's set of custom gestures to change drawing utensils and switch between erase and draw mode.  See myo-artist/sdk/samples/hello-myo.cpp to see the code for this project (Developed and tested with XCode on MacOSX).
